### Description 
This Web app was to help our class learn React by making a note-app. Users can add, delete, edit, and move notes around the 
webpage. When the user refreshes the page, the notes will stay.

### What Worked and Didn't Work 
I definiteley struggled with the concept of properties versus states when I first started off using React. However, I think I got a hang of it once I started creating more methods and seeing how properties and states were used. Arrow notation for making methods was also initially confusing, but I also eventually got the a hang of it. Implementing the firebase was fairly straightforward once I wrote out all of the functions. 
### Extra Credit 
- I made sure the Notes wouldn't get stuck if the user accidently pushed a note too far out of the page. 
- My Notes will Increase in Size when the user adds too much text or too large of an Image. 
- I added some textures to the background and the notes to make it look like a cork board with paper notes. I also added drop shadows to make them look more 3D.
