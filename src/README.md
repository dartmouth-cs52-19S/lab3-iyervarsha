# Lab 3
## Varsha Iyer
## COSC 52

### Description 
### What Worked
### What Didn't Work
### Extra Credit 
- I made sure the Notes wouldn't get stuck if the user accidently pushed a note too far out of the page. 
- My Notes will Increase in Size when the user adds too much text or too large of an Image. 
- I added some textures to the background and the notes to make it look like a cork board with paper notes. I also added drop shadows to make them look more 3D.
